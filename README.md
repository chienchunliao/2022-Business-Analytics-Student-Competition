Abstract:
Super Server Company should identify and pursue clients with the highest likelihood of purchase using data analysis in order to maximize profit. 
Machine learning classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network, were used to label each customer account as either a potential buyer (1) or not a potential buyer (0). 
The most accurate models were then used in an ensemble to produce the best predictive model. 
In conclusion, we predicted the probability of each account belonging to the “buyer” class with 0.91 accuracy.
